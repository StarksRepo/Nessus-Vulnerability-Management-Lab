# Vulnerability-Management-Lab
## Description
My goal with this project is to walk through the basics of vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, two important pieces in the overarching Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.
## Utilities Used
* Nessus Essentials (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true)
* Oracle VM Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Mozilla Firefox
* Windows 10 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)
## Objectives
* Install and configure Nessus and perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 host.
* Implement Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox network:
  * Discover, Prioritize, Asses, Report, Remediate, Verify.
* Conduct vulnerability assessments with Nessus; and then remediate the vulnerabilities.
## Virtal Machine Setup
1. First we will download Windows 10 ISO File and Oracle VM Virtual Box.
2. Once you have installed the VM open it and click **Machine > New**
3. Name the machine whatever you want and select your Windows 10 Pro image for the **ISO Image** prompt.
4. On the **Unattended Guest OS Install Setup** page: Create an easy to remember username and password, nothing else on this page needs to be changed nor will a product key be needed.
5. On the next page, you can leave the default ram and virtual CPU count, or adjust them to the specs of your system for better performance.
6. The same applies to the Virtual Hard Disk page, I used 50 GB. After doing so you’re safe to click *'next'* all the way through until you see the *'finish'* button then you’re good to go.
7. Now, right click on your new VM and click settings. Go to the network tab and change *'Attached To"* to *'Bridged Connection'* and then click *'Okay.'* Pictured below are the final specs for the VM I created.

8. Start up your new VM and let Windows install. Make sure when setting up Windows that you choose not to connect to the internet, it can lead to unnecessary complications for what we’re trying to do. After starting up, open the **RUN (Win + R)** and type *firewall.cpl.* See screenshot below.

9. In the firewall settings, you’ll see text that says ‘Turn Windows Firewall On or Off’. Click this and then you should turn off both the Private and Public firewall settings. (I understand this isn't the best practice but we need to get hands on with Nessus.)

## Nesses Essentials Setup
1. Nessus Essentials is free for download at [tenable.com/downloads](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true). 
2. Once Nessus Essentials is installed and registered, you will be directed to the web portal to register your activation key then you will set up your Nessus Administrator User Account. 
3. Make sure the the account credentials are something easy to remember also make sure you are selecting Nesses Essentials upon the registration.

## First Scan (Non Credentialed)
* Our first scan against the Windows 10 victim machine will be just a basic network scan. No credentials will be provided for this scan so I don't expect to get many vulnerabilites detected.
1. Click **New Scan** in the upper right hand corner and then select **Basic Network Scan.**
2. Name your scan whatever you please, type the IP address of your virtual machine in the **"Target"** area. (You can find your IP by using the command line in your virtual machine and typing *"ipconfig"*.) Atfer doing so, you can select **"launch".**
## First Scan Results

* Running a basic network scan against the victim IP Address we were able to get a lot of general information about the host such as its operating system, ethernet MAC address, and FQDN resolution. 

* These findings are sorted in the “Info” severity category as it is not an indication of a direct security risk but serves as a notice that this information was able to be discovered by using just a basic network scan.

* For each vulnerability detected Nessus provides a brief description of the vulnerability and a possible solution to remediate it. Various support articles are also referenced for additional information.
## Second Scan (Credentialed with Deprecated Program)
* Our third scan will be installing a deprecated version of Firefox to see what vulnerabilites Nessus picks up.

* We are also going to add our Windows credentials to the scan, I expect the scanner to pick up several vulnerabilites.
