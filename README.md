# Vulnerability-Management-Lab
## Description
My goal with this project is to walk through the basics of vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, two important pieces in the overarching Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. To do this we will be setting up a virtual box with Windows 10 Pro installed and using Nessus Essentials to run three different vulnerability scans against our target machine which are; an uncredentialed scan, credential scan, and a credentialed scan with a deprecated application.
## Utilities Used
* Nessus Essentials
* Oracle VM Virtual Box
* Mozilla Firefox
* Windows 10
## Objectives
* Install and configure Nessus and perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 host.
* Implement Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox network:
  * Discover, Prioritize, Asses, Report, Remediate, Verify.
* Conduct vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediate vulnerabilities.
## Virtal Machine Setup
1. Create a new virtual machine (Machine > New)
2. Name the machine whatever you want and select your Windows 10 Pro image for the **ISO Image** prompt.
3. On the **Unattended Guest OS Install Setup** page: Create an easy to remember username and password, nothing else on this page needs to be changed. No product key will be needed.
4. On the next page, you can leave the default ram and virtual CPU count, or adjust them to the specs of your system for better performance.
5. The same applies to the Virtual Hard Disk page. I used 50 gb. Then you’re safe to ‘next’ through until you see the finish button and you’re good to go.
6. Now, right click on your new VM and click settings. Go to the network tab and switch where it says **Attached To: to Bridged Connection** and then click Okay. Pictured below are the final specs for the VM.

7. Start up your new VM and let Windows install. Make sure when setting up windows that you choose not to connect to the internet, it can lead to unnecessary complications for what we’re trying to do. After starting up, open the **RUN (Win + R)** and type *firewall.cpl.* See screenshot below.

9. In the firewall settings, you’ll see text that says ‘Turn Windows Firewall On or Off’. Click this and then you should turn off both the Private and Public firewall settings. (I understand this isn't the best practice but I am wanting to get hands on with Nessus.)
