# Vulnerability-Management-Lab
## Description
My goal with this project is to walk through the basics of vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, two important pieces in the overarching Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. To do this we will be setting up a virtual box with Windows 10 Pro installed and using Nessus Essentials to run three different vulnerability scans against our target machine which are; an uncredentialed scan, credential scan, and a credentialed scan with a deprecated application.
## Utilities Used
* Nessus Essentials
* Oracle Virtual Box
* Mozilla Firefox
* Windows 10
## Objectives
* Install and configure Nessus and perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 host.
* Implement Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox network:
  * Discover, Prioritize, Asses, Report, Remediate, Verify.
* Conduct vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediate vulnerabilities.
